Absolute pandemonium has ensued. You have seen a ridiculous surge in the polls, and Hillary's whereabouts are currently unknown.

Tricked them into thinking that she was a sweet nice grandma, and that Ted Cruz was a radical. They were actually dumb enough to fall for it. Of course they did. Absolute morons.<br><br>Her campaign staff told her to get ready to say her victory speech - after all, everyone had just decided to elect her 538 electoral votes to zero. She didn't even care. Because she had no intentions of looking nice with the public. She already started planning out what she would do next.<br><br>On the very first day of her term, she dismantled the Constitution. How did she do it? Listen... don't ask me how she managed to do it... but she planted a bomb inside the Capitol building and set it to go off.<br><br>BAM!<br><br>474 out of 475 Senators and Representatives were killed instantly. Only one, Ted Cruz, survived, but he was laying down on the floor, struggling to survive. Clinton made sure that the bomb denotated as far as possible from Cruz.<br><br>As the cameras were watching her, and then she rushed in.<br><br>Hillary Clinton got into the building. Was he going to get saved? Of course not. Ted Cruz was just laying down, struggling to understand what was happening. “What.. are you doing here..?” Cruz said. Clinton merely chuckled. The chuckling turned into cackling, the cackling into laughing, and the laughing into straight up taunting. She then stopped laughing, and her face became serious.<br><br>“You. You're the one behind why America is so bad.”<br><br>“Huh?”<br><br>Hillary slapped her face. “Why do I even try anymore...” she said. Before Ted could respond, she pulled out her M1911 and started laughing again. “Give me one reason why I shouldn't shoot you right now.”<br><br>“Uh... well... I...”<br><br>POW!<br><br>Her bullet landed straight through his skull, causing a cerebral hemmorage and massive bleeding. Instead of finishing him off, Hillary just left the building, continuing to laugh on her way out.<br><br>She started crying as soon as she reached the cameras. "No-nobody surv-ived..." she said. People felt so sorry for her. She then went down on the floor and cried. Those weren't tears of sadness. Those were tears of joy. Ted Cruz could hear her lying, but he wasn't able to call for help. He bled out a few minutes later.<br><br>After being behind the bombing of Capitol Hill, she feigned innocence and pretended that ISIS had just bombed the Capitol building, and the public was none the wiser. She declared a “national state of emergency” and granted herself “additional powers.” With those powers, she dismantled the Constiution.<br><br>Was that even legal? Nope. But who's gonna stop her? What is Congress gonna do, impeach her?<br><br>She then suspended habeus corpus and ordered any and all people who have ever voted for a Republican, a Libertarian, or Green party candidate to be known as “enemies of the state” and executed. Things were going great. Her plan to turn the country into a communist-nationalist-facist state was succeeding wonderfully. She and Putin went from enemies to best friends. In fact, a few months earlier, Putin had invaded Ukraine and all of NATO and reformed the Soviet Union. The world is now perfect, all thanks to our wonderful and glorious leader, Hillary Clinton.`);
